# Introduction

Pedestrian and bicyclist safety across the U.S. has declined significantly over the past several decades. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, 7,388 pedestrians were killed in motor vehicle crashes in 2021 which represents a 12.5 percent increase from 2020 and a 40 year high (U.S. DOT, 2023). Fatal accidents involving bicyclists have also increased in recent years with 948 cyclists killed in motor vehicle crashes in 2020 and 966 cyclists killed in motor vehicle crashes 2021 (U.S. DOT, 2023).

# Research Questions

1.  Are national trends in fatal accidents involving pedestrians and cyclists present at the state level?
2.  What is the geospatial distribution of crashes involving pedestrians and bicyclists across NYS by county?
3.  What are the most common causes of pedestrian and cyclist fatalities in NYS?
4.  What are the highest ranking municipalities in NYS when it comes to pedestrian and cyclist fatalities?

# Examples

## Example 1

```{r, out.width="100%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Repos/final-project-andreaharder/IMG/Example1.png")
```

This graphic shows pedestrian fatalities from 2019 to 2023 across the United States and is helpful in understanding how trends have changed overtime. Pedestrian fatalities have increased by 14% since 2019. A similar graphic could be made to assess fatal crashes involving pedestrians and cyclists in NYS overtime.

##Example 2

```{r, out.width="100%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Repos/final-project-andreaharder/IMG/Example2.jpg")
```

This choropleth map can be used to communicate the geospatial distribution of pedestrian fatalities across the United States. States with darker colors have a higher rate of pedestrian fatalities per 100,000 people compared to states with lighter colors. For example, New Mexico has the highest death rate at 4.68 and Nebraska has the lowest death rate at 0.71. This map could be reproduced to show the geospatial distribution of fatal crashes in NYS by county.

## Example 3

```{r, out.width="100%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Repos/final-project-andreaharder/IMG/Example3.png")
```

The graphic above shows the most common causes of fatal accidents in 2017. Speeding is the most common cause of accidents involving motorists followed by other factors, driving under the influence, and failure to keep in the proper lane. Similar graphics could be used to communicate the most common causes of accidents involving pedestrians and cyclists in NYS.

## Example 4

```{r, out.width="100%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Repos/final-project-andreaharder/IMG/Example4.jpg")
```

This picture shows a dot density map of highway crashes in the U.S. by location. Dot densities are generally higher along the east coast where population densities are higher. A similar map could be made for NYS to show the geospatial distribution of fatal crashes.

## Example 5

```{r, out.width="100%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Repos/final-project-andreaharder/IMG/Example5.png")
```

The graphic pictured above shows the 20 most dangerous cities for drivers in California. This graphic could be reproduced to show the highest ranking municipalities in NYS when it comes to fatal crashes involving both pedestrians and cyclists.

# Proposed Data Sources

This project will utilize two datasets that are free and publicly available online. The first dataset includes motor vehicle crash information provided by the NYS Department of Transportation (DOT) from 2018 to 2022. This dataset includes all motor vehicle crashes in NYS but can be filtered to identify fatal crashes only involving pedestrians and cyclists. There is a lot of rich information in this dataset pertaining to crashes across both space and time. Each entry includes a variety of details about the crash including the municipality, county, month, day of the week, lighting conditions, weather, and presence of a traffic control device. These variables can be used to understand some of the common factors and causes of pedestrian and cyclist fatalities. This dataset also includes location information through the provision of a DOT reference marker. A table join will be used to connect DOT reference marker information in the motor vehicle crash dataset with vetcor data in a NYSDOT reference markers shapefile. By doing this, a dot density map can be created to show the geospatial distribution of crashes in NYS.

# Proposed Methods

The dplyr package will be used to filter and count crashes involving pedestrians and cyclists by type, time, and location. Following the filtering of the data, the ggplot2 package can be used to reproduce the examples described above. More specifically the:

1.  geom_line() and geom_point() functions will be used to create a line graph showing trends in fatal accidents overtime.

2.  geom_sf() function will be used to create a choropleth map of fatal accidents by county.

3.  geom_col() function will be used to create bar charts showing common causes of accidents and the 20 highest ranking cities in NYS in terms of pedestrian and bicyclist fatalities.

4.  geom_point() function will be used to create a dot density map showing the geospatial distribution of crashes in NYS.

# Expected Results

Following the analysis and visualization of the data, the following results are expected:

1.  Trends in fatal pedestrian and bicyclist crashes in NYS are expected to mirror trends at the national level and increase from 2018 to 2022.

2.  Poor weather, lighting, and traffic conditions will be more commonly associated with fatal crashes compared to favorable conditions.

3.  Crash patterns will show clustering in urban areas with fatal crashes happening less frequently in rural areas.
